<h1>HSA Protein Sequence Analysis Repository</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This repository contains a Python-based analysis tool designed to assist in the identification and selection of human serum albumin (HSA) protein fragments. These fragments are crucial for the production of antibodies with high specificity for human blood plasma proteins, aiding forensic applications.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sequence Retrieval:</strong> Automates the downloading of HSA and mammalian serum albumin sequences from public databases.</li>
    <li><strong>Sequence Comparison:</strong> Compares HSA sequences to mammalian counterparts to identify regions of high similarity and uniqueness.</li>
    <li><strong>Fragment Selection:</strong> Chooses 15 amino acid long HSA fragments that are unique to humans or conserved across mammals, for antibody production.</li>
    <li><strong>Phylogenetic Analysis:</strong> Generates a phylogenetic tree to visualize the evolutionary relationship between the serum albumin sequences of different mammals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>BioPython Library</li>
</ul>
